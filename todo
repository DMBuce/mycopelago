Description
--
The world is overgrown with fungi. The only lifeforms are mushroom-infected cows. Everything is soft and spongy.

Welcome to Mycopelago, a survival-mushroom-island-with-magic modpack.

Mycopelago
/mīˈkōˈpeləˌɡō/
*noun*
1. A sea or stretch of water containing many mushroom islands.
Etymology: From Greek *myco-* "fungus" + *pelagos* "sea".

The early game is a survival island experience. You'll need to scavenge in caves, pilfer abandoned mines, and fish the sea for resources. Those resources give access to psionic and electroblobby magic for tools. They also unlock fungal magic and eldritch mysteries that you can use to construct a portal to the nether, where you'll find lava for cobble generation.

At that point, the game opens up a lot and offers several things.

First of all you can complete the mushroom island challenge. Claim an island and replace all those mushrooms with beautiful green grass to create a peaceful haven for yourself. Use lighting aesthetically without fear of hostile mobs.

There are also interesting automation puzzles. Fishing nets can be automated for most resources. You won't have saplings until the endgame, so you'll have to find other ways to generate wood.

All the big magic mods are present, so you can explore Botania, Thaumcraft, Blood Magic, Astral Sorcery, Wizardry, Electroblob's Wizardry, and Magical Psi.

For those of you who want some kind of end game goal, there's a 5x5 crafting recipe for Oak and Tree of Life saplings. Good luck, have fun!

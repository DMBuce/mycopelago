Description
--
(TODO: work in a blurb about high-difficulty areas like Monuments, Cave Spiders
       ... and also that non-overworld dimensions are "as close to a procedurally generated Vex SuperHostile map as I could manage with the tools available to me, and without compromising fun."

The world is overgrown with fungi. The only lifeforms are mushroom-infected cows. Everything is soft and spongy.

Welcome to Mycopelago, a survival-mushroom-island-with-magic modpack.

Mycopelago
/mīˈkōˈpeləˌɡō/
*noun*
1. A sea or stretch of water containing many mushroom islands.
Etymology: From Greek *myco-* "fungus" + *pelagos* "sea".

The early game is a survival island experience. There are no trees or stone so you'll need to scavenge in caves, pilfer abandoned mines, and fish the sea for resources. From these scraps, you can bootstrap your way to psionic and electroblobby magic for tools, unlock fungal magic and eldritch mysteries to construct a portal, and travel to the nether where you'll find lava for cobble generation.

At that point, the game opens up a lot and offers several things.

First of all, there are interesting automation puzzles. Fishing nets can be automated for most resources. You won't have saplings until the midgame, so you'll have to find other ways to generate wood. Each of the five main elements (Flora, Fungi, Blood, Starlight and Vis) offer ways to transmute non-tree matter into wood, so you have plenty of options.

You can also complete the mushroom island challenge. Claim an island and replace all that mycelia with beautiful green grass to create a peaceful haven for yourself. Use dim lighting aesthetically without fear of hostile mobs. In the midgame, you can use your magic to create saplings and reforest your homestead.

All the big magic mods are present, so you can explore Botania, Thaumcraft, Blood Magic, Astral Sorcery, Wizardry, Electroblob's Wizardry, and Magical Psi.

Near the end game you can also grow the Tree of Life. Who knows what precious mysteries it contains?

Good luck, have fun!

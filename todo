Mycopelago
/mīˈkəˈpeləˌɡō/
*noun*
1. A sea or stretch of water containing many mushroom islands.
Etymology: From Greek *myco-* "fungus" + *pelagos* "sea".

Chapter 1: Mushroom Overworld w/ Botania
===

The world is overgrown with fungi. The only lifeforms are mushroom-infected cows. Everything is soft and spongy.
Basically you start in a Mushroom Biome world. Your ultimate goal is to get to a "true overworld" dimension where terrain generates normally, but at this stage in the game your sights are set on getting to the Nether. To that end, the tools you have available are Botania and Magical Psi.

Resources you have in abundance:

* Dirt from Mycelium
* Steak, Leather, and Bones from Mooshroom
* Mushrooms
* Water

Resources you don't have access to in the early game:

* Cobblestone
* Stone
* Ores
* Saplings
* Lava

With no stone for tools, you have to rely on Magical Psi to interact with the world. I know fuck all about that mod so its progression is left as a design exercise.

Ruins dot the landscape. Some of them have a Petal Apothecary so that you can bootstrap into Botania. The Pure Daisy gives you access to materials not found in this world. It converts Giant Mushroom blocks to Livingwood, Sandstone to Livingrock, and Livingrock to Obsidian.

That should be enough to get you to the Nether but if gameplay demands it,

* Mana pearls are made from slimeballs obtained from spawners in Shrines to Juiblex
* Mana bricks (alternative to manasteel) are made from clay bricks
* Those Thaumcraft structures with Witch Spawners give access to mana dust


Chapter 2a: Nether w/ Blood Magic
===

For the adventurous. Lots of danger. High risk, high reward.

Pigmen and Endermen are hostile, not neutral.

The nether gives access to ores, Blood Magic, and Thaumcraft.



Chapter 2b: The End w/ Astral Sorcery
===

For the tinkerers. Slow but steady progress that rewards automation.

Other than the "true overworld", this is the only dimension that has starlight for Astral Sorcery.



Chapter 3: Escape Overworld w/ Thaumcraft // Mystcraft
Chapter 3: Bust Through Bedrock w/ Thaumcraft
===

Trick some kind of entity into giving you the power to form a realm of your own design.

or

Discover a subterranean world beneath bedrock.

or

You were underground, discover the overworld above you.
